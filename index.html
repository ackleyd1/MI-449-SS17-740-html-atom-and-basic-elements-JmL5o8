<h1>Ricky Mizzoula Resume</h1>

<p>Yo I'm Ricky Mizz.
I'm looking for a gig at a restaurant engineering new efficient noodle shapes.
This has been a long time dream of mine, ever since Ma served my first bowl of pasta.
I'm a hands-on learner, I'm quick on my feet, and I'm a visionary in the field of innovative noodle shapes.
I've published several papers on the noodle shape meta.
They were well received by the community and you might recognize these household titles.
<h2>Published Papers</h2>
<ul>
  <li><em>Key or Gnocchi</em></li>
  <li><em>Ravioli, Ravioli, Give Me The Formuoli</em></li>
  <li><em>Penne for my Thoughts</em></li>
</ul>
</p>
